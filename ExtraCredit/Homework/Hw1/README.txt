1. DEFINE your test functions within a Python script:
   - Function should perform tasks and assert conditions.
   
2. IF using simple test functions WITHOUT a framework:
   - RUN the script directly with Python to execute tests.
   - Example command: python my_test_script.py

3. ELSE IF using the unittest framework:
   - IMPORT unittest
   - CREATE a test class that inherits from unittest.TestCase.
   - DEFINE test methods within this class, each prefixed with 'test'.
   - USE unittest's assertion methods to test conditions.
   - ADD boilerplate code to run tests if script is executed directly.
   - RUN tests either by direct script execution or via the unittest module.
     - Example commands:
       - Direct: python my_unittest_script.py
       - Module: python -m unittest my_unittest_script.py

4. ELSE IF using pytest for testing:
   - ENSURE pytest is installed.
   - ORGANIZE tests in functions within files named according to pytest's discovery rules.
   - USE simple assert statements for conditions.
   - RUN pytest to automatically discover and execute tests.
     - Example command: pytest

5. SELECT the approach based on project needs and complexity.
